Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- The system will be creating a .git file, which is a git repository that tracks file within that directory. This is to keep track our files


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The Staging area basically a place where we can combine files that were added from the working directory and can be stored in the repository by using git commit.
- Working directory just basically stores files to be tracked. The only thing that it cannot do is, to make files to be in a grouped in a commit.
- Repository just basically saves files added by the staging area, in a grouped commit or not.
